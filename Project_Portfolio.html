<h2>DocuTuck – AI PDF Chatbot</h2>
<div class="meta">Artificial Intelligence • Document Intelligence • Award Winning Project</div>
<p>
DocuTuck was created to solve the challenge of reading and searching extremely large PDF documents
that can span hundreds or even thousands of pages, such as textbooks, legal documents, research papers,
and technical manuals. Manually scrolling and searching through these documents is inefficient and time-consuming.
</p>
<p>
Users simply upload a PDF and ask questions in natural language. The system intelligently retrieves
relevant sections using vector embeddings and generates summarized answers instantly. This removes the need
to manually copy content into external AI tools for summarization.
</p>
<p>
The project won First Prize in the Department Project Expo (2023–2024) for its practical usefulness
and strong technical implementation.

<h2>Smart Stump Vision – AI for Cricket Decisions</h2>
<div class="meta">Computer Vision • Deep Learning • Real-Time Analytics</div>
<p>
Smart Stump Vision is an AI-powered computer vision system designed to support cricket umpiring decisions,
especially in close situations such as run-outs and stumpings. The system detects critical objects including
the bat, foot, and ground using a trained YOLOv8 model.
</p>
<p>
A depth estimation module calculates the spatial distance between detected objects, enabling accurate
judgment of whether the bat or foot crossed the crease before the wicket was broken. The system operates
in real time and demonstrates practical application of deep learning in sports analytics.
</p>
</section>

<section id="printingapp">
<h2>Student Printing Service Web Application</h2>
<div class="meta">Web Development • Cloud Deployment • Production System</div>
<p>
This web application allows college students to upload documents remotely for printing and collect the
printouts using a system-generated order ID. Students no longer need to physically visit the printing center
multiple times to submit files.
</p>
<p>
The platform is currently live and actively used by more than 400 students every day. It improves
operational efficiency, reduces waiting time, and provides better accessibility across the campus.
</p>
</section>

<section id="firearmsafety">
<h2>Smart Geo-Fenced Safety System for Licensed Firearms</h2>
<div class="meta">IoT • Embedded Systems • Hardware Prototyping</div>
<p>
This project focuses on improving firearm safety using an IoT-based access control mechanism. An ESP32
microcontroller, RFID authentication, and a servo motor work together to automatically lock or unlock
the trigger mechanism based on authorized access.
</p>
<p>
A physical prototype was designed and safely tested using a 3D-printed PLA model created in Fusion 360.
The system demonstrates secure embedded design and hardware-software integration.
</p>
</section>

<section id="diseasepred">
<h2>Smart Disease Prediction from Medical Reports</h2>
<div class="meta">OCR • Machine Learning • Healthcare Automation</div>
<p>
This web application extracts text from medical reports including handwritten, scanned, and typed documents
using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The extracted data is processed using a trained machine learning model
to predict potential diseases.
</p>
<p>
The platform helps hospital staff reduce manual workload, improve diagnosis speed, and assign doctors more efficiently
in high-traffic medical environments.
</p>
</section>

<section id="rationshop">
<h2>Ration Shop Management & Automated Citizen Notification System</h2>
<div class="meta">Smart Governance • Messaging Automation • Social Impact</div>
<p>
This system enables ration shop managers to update shop timings, product availability, and holiday schedules
through a secure web portal. Citizens receive automated notifications via SMS, WhatsApp, or voice calls,
even without smartphones or internet access.
</p>
<p>
The platform reduces unnecessary travel, improves transparency, and ensures better accessibility for rural communities.
It also maintains collection tracking and reporting for operational monitoring.
</p>
</section>

<section id="instalead">
<h2>Instagram AI Lead Capture & Chat Automation</h2>
<div class="meta">RAG • CRM Automation • Production AI Systems</div>
<p>
An enterprise-grade automation system that intelligently reads Instagram messages, responds automatically,
and captures lead details such as name, phone number, and email ID. Conversation memory is maintained using
a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline backed by Qdrant.
</p>
<p>
Sentiment analysis identifies high-potential customers. Qualified leads are automatically synced into Google Sheets
and Zoho CRM for the marketing team to process, while spam and duplicates are filtered.
</p>
</section>

<section id="influencermarketing">
<h2>AI Influencer Marketing Agent</h2>
<div class="meta">Automation • AI Video Generation • Scalable Systems</div>
<p>
This automation platform converts influencer photos and scripts into professional social media videos without
manual editing. The pipeline handles background replacement, AI voice generation, and video rendering automatically.
</p>
<p>
The system supports high-volume content generation for influencer marketing campaigns and significantly reduces
production cost and turnaround time.
